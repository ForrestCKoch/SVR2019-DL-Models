Planning for Summarization Statistics Code
------------------------------------------
### Statistics of Interest
- [Hopkin's Statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins_statistic)
- [Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score.html#sklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score)
 - Note this is a comparison between labellings ...
- Correlation between dissimilarity matrix before/after dimension reduction?
 - Use [Mantel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantel_test)?
 
 #### Combination Scores
- [Calinksi Harabaz Score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.calinski_harabaz_score.html#sklearn.metrics.calinski_harabaz_score)
 - ratio between the within-cluster dispersion and the between-cluster dispersion.
- [Davies Bouldin](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.davies_bouldin_score.html#sklearn.metrics.davies_bouldin_score)
  - ratio of within-cluster distances to between-cluster distances
- [Silhouette Score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html#sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score)
   - Measure of how similar each point is to it's own cluster w.r.t other clusters
- [Dunn Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunn_index) (requires implementation)
 - Note: Seems simple? It is the minimum intercluster distance divided by the maximum within cluster distance.
 - Implementation should be invariant to distance function provided.

### Visualization Ideas
- Further reduce down to 2 dimensions and colour accordingly
- Histogram of inter/intra cluster distances
-  ...
 
 Analsysis Ideas
 ---------------
- Perform dimension reduction through various technqiues (save embeddings!!)
 - PCA
 - UMAP
 - SDAE
 - ...
- Use the above measures to compare approaches
- Potentially apply DBSCAN and generate further measures?
 - How to select appropriate DBSCAN parameters ...
