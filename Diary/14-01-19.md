* [Duo 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6134335/) makes reference to an R package [DuoClustering2018](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/DuoClustering2018.html) which provides access to each of the datasets used in their paper
  * See [link](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/manuals/DuoClustering2018/man/DuoClustering2018.pdf) for documentation
  * Original code is available [here](https://github.com/markrobinsonuzh/scRNAseq_clustering_comparison)
* [Tian 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/08/433102) have made 10 datasets available for the purpose of benchmarking
  * Code available [here](https://github.com/LuyiTian/CellBench_data)
  * GEO SuperSeries [GSE118767](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118767)
  * Note: It seems that they don't provide a 'ground-truth' in this dataset.  Instead the paper states:
  > To obtain truth for the single cell datasets, ... , we used *Demuxlet*, which exploits the genetic differences between the three different cell lines to determine the most likely identity of each cell.
