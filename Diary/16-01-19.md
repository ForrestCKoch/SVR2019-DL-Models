- [CIDR](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1188-0)
- [Component retention in principal component analysis with application to cDNA microarray data (2007)](https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6150-2-2)
  - Provides some good advice regarding how many components to retain in PCA

## Deep Learning Application
- [Parameter tuning is a key part of dimensionality reduction via deep variational autoencoders for single cell RNA transcriptomics (2019)](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813279827_0033)
  - Very similar to the comparison I was thinking of doing
  - Uses Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  - Testing is only done on simulated datasets?
  - Finds that if VAE parameters are well chosen, the result is superior to existing methods
- [Using neural networks for reducing the dimensions of single-cell RNA-Seq data (2017)](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/17/e156/4056711)
  - Uses very crude/trivial networks
- [Using autoencoders and text mining to characterize single cell populations in the hippocampus and cortex (2018)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8374718)
  - DAE is used for feature extraction of each cluster, not for dimensionality reduction
- [Interpretable dimensionality reduction of single cell transcriptome data with deep generative models (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04368-5)
  - Uses a "probabilistic generative model" (GAN/VAE?) for dimension reduction (scVis)
  - Intended for visualization, not necessarily accurate clustering???

Preprocessing Notes
-------------------
- [Scater](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/8/1179/2907823)
- Lin 2017 normalizes data by converting to Transcripts Per Million (TPM)
  - After normalization and imputation, each gene was normalized to a standard normal distribution
    - They claim this is an essential step for NN training???
    - We are working with count data here -- why should we expect this to follow a gaussian?  Surely a Poisson or Negative Binomial is more appropriate?
