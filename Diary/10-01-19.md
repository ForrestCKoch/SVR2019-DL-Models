Today I'm taking a step back to think about what my aims are and how to acheive them ...

## Possible Aims
1) To detect novel cell types within the 1.3m cell dataset
2) Compare clustering algorithms on single cell data
3) ``Compare visualation on sc data?``

## Discussion
Now, in order to achieve (1), you need:
a) a technique which you feel confident is capable of identifying unique/novel/distinct cell types
b) a way of validation these cell types after the analysis

To satisfy (a), we need an understanding of the results of (2)

*But*, presumably we want/need to introduce a DL based approach
- If the results of (2) do not indicate that a DL approach is optimal, do we attempt to improve existing methods?
  - This would be a large undertaking in and of itself, likely requiring a separate validation study
 
 Aditionally, the method chosen for (a) should fascilitate (b):
 - Can new data be incorporated?
 - What sort of inferences can be made?
 
 For either points (2) or (3), pleanty of literature exists on these oints and a literature review would probably be the most appropriate.

## Moving forward ...
- Research critera for comparing clusterings
- Research critera for comparing dimensionality reductions
- Find benchmark datasets to help establish empiracle benefits
